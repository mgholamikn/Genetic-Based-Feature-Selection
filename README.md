# Genetic-Based Feature Selection

Genetic algortihm (GA) has been frequently used as a feature selection method for machine learning problems. Defining number of desired features is not feasible with this method. In this project we have modified "mutation" and "cross over" functions of GA in order to input number of desired features to the algorithm.
