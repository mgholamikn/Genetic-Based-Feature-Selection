# Genetic-Based Feature Selection

The genetic algorithm (GA) has been frequently used as a feature selection method for machine learning problems. Defining the number of desired features is not feasible with this method. In this project we have modified "mutation" and "cross over" functions of GA to input the number of desired features to the algorithm.
